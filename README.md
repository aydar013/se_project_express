# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application.

## Functionality

This project created to serve back-end portion of WTWR application.
Now the application has the ability to create user with hashed password for extra security reasons, delete, update, like and dislike, and see the information about the user. Also it checks if the email is unique, and if you're owner of created profile to have the ability to delete the profile.
